## Blockchain

If you're interested in learning Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum, head to the `solidity` folder in this repository. There you'll find examples of smart contracts written in Solidity that you can study and better understand how this language works.

On the other hand, if you want to see some decentralized applications (Dapps) in action, head to the `Dapps` folder. There you'll find examples of Dapps that have been built with Ethereum and other blockchain protocols, which you can explore to gain a better understanding of how these applications work.
